In short a crap load. Muhaha. Is there a need or want to continue this project.

- Scan.php need to figure out how slack processes the php results as html and \r does not process to seperate php output.
- Add scans as subprocesses with wait commands to make sure the user knwos it is running and the system waits till completed.
- Add error checking to the code
  - Check to see if VPN is up and start if not.
  - Maybe test malicious scan requests for security  (once all done)
- Add additional modules for enumeration.
 - directory checking
 - additional nmap with scripts
 - check exploit-db / search sploit for vulns.
 - exploiting
 - shared shells
- Add a DB or other storage for storing executed scans and have the system check locally before rescanning / unless forced.
